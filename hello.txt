Ensure that you are running PowerShell with administrator privileges. Right-click on your PowerShell shortcut and choose "Run as Administrator."
Regarding the messages that seem to be mistaken for commands ("replaced," "warning," "error"), it's possible that there's some confusion in the way you're entering or copying and pasting commands. Ensure that you are entering valid Git commands and not including the warning or error messages themselves.

If you need further assistance, feel free to provide the specific Git commands you are trying to execute, and I can help clarify or troubleshoot them.
